Java, Eclipse, T and TA, SD37!

# Lessons Learned

	I did pretty well with creating the methods. Including creating the parameters and returns. I initially created a method for each prompt. However, I had trouble figuring out how to close the scanner in each method. I overhear TA Eric discussing the issue with another student, so I moved the prompts into Main.

	I had a lot of trial and error with which variables needed formatting and the math aspect.

	I struggled with formatting the sysout on lines 60 and 64. I had to get help from a classmate. Definitely need to study this aspect more.
